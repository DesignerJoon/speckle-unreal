Plugin for Unreal Engine to import objects from Speckle v2.


Screencast of an example: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2551138/114720093-61403e00-9d40-11eb-8045-6e8ca656554d.mp4




## NOTICE

* Our Unreal Connector is in an beta stage of development. Currently we only support receiving objects, and there is no UI to fetch lists of streams/commits/branches.
* We officially support Unreal Engine 4.26 and 4.27, and have experimental support for UE5.
* Does not use the Speckle Kit workflow as conversions all happen in C++. 

## How To Install


1. Download `speckle-unreal` repository archive from https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unreal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip 
1. Extract the downloaded archive into your project's `Plugins` directory (if your project directory doesn't contain a directory called Plugins, you should create it)
1. Open your UE project (or restart the editor if you already have it opened). This will build the plugin in your environment.

We will eventually look to distributing the plugin officially on the Unreal Engine Marketplace but for now you'll need to install the plugin manually like this.

See our [docs](https://speckle.guide/user/unreal.html) for usage instructions.
